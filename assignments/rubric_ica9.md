# Rubric for ICA 9

## One-side MPI

Just code again. Steve Fromm's looks good and I've copied mine below. Basically, just check that they submitted code that makes sense. If the submitted, clean code that seems right, give them 10 points. If they could clean up the code some, tell them how and give them 8. Non-working code or just a mess, give them 5.

10 points total for the assignment.
