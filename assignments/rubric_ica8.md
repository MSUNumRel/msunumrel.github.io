# Rubric for ICA 8

## Custom data types in MPI

Again, this one is only code. Basically, just check that they submitted code that makes sense. There are two files they should have committed: `create_struct.cpp` and `mpi_subcommReduce.cpp`. Split it 5 points a piece and check for clean, "compliant" code and correctness.

10 points total for the assignment.
