# Rubric for ICA 7

## Latency hiding

This one is pretty straightforward, only code submitted. Basically, just check that they submitted code that makes sense. You can be a little stricter on the coding standards, if you like, but this one should be quick to grade! If the submitted, clean code that seems right, give them 10 points. If they could clean up the code some, tell them how and give them 8. Non-working code or just a mess, give them 5.

10 points total for the assignment.
