# Rubric for ICA 6

## Ping Pong and Other Fun with MPI

Be generous here with their interpretation of the prompt. The main thing I wanted them to get at was comparing intra-node communication to inter-node communication. 

1. Did they write a sensible ping-pong code using blocking MPI? (2 points)
2. Did they correctly modify the code to use non-blocking MPI? (2 points)
3. Did they perform a reasonable performance study (i.e., sufficient statistics, etc.)? (2 points)
4. Did they make a decent plot? (2 points)
5. Did they give reasonably accurate estimates for latency and bandwidth and a brief explanation? (2 points)

10 points total for the assignment.
