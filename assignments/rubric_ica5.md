1. Did they put the correct MPI boilerplate stuff in? (1 point) Did they include a `MPI_Reduce` call in the correct way to collect results? (2 point)
2. Did they correctly include timers? Depending on how they interpreted this prompt, the answer to whether the runtime changes could change. Be generous. (2 points)
3. Did they divide up the work amongst the ranks in a sensible manner? Again, be forgiving if their interpretation of the prompt was different than what I meant... (2 points)
