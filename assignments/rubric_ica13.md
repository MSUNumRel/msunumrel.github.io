# Rubric for ICA 13

## OpenMP Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

Check for sensible code (5 points). 2 points for some comment about their thread speedup. 2 points for scaling data that make sense. 1 point for a decent plot. Several of the plots that I spot-checked were very ugly... Feel free to ding them. Take 0.5 points off from the plot if they did linear-linear scaling. smh.

10 points total.
