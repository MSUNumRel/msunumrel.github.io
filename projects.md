# Course Projects

More details about the course projects will be developed as the course proceeds. For now, here is are the basics.

## Midterm Project

For the midterm, you will develop a Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) solver to compute the hydrostatic structure of a relativistic neutron star. You will use this to determine the maximum masses of cold neutron stars for several different equations of state.

## Final Project

_Subject to change._

For the final project, you will work as a group to develop a general relativistic hydrodynamics solver, solving for the spacetime evolution using the conformal flatness approximation. The ultimate goal of this project will be a peer-reviewed publication in a suitable journal co-authored by the entire class.
