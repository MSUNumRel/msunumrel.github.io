# Final Projects

## Project topics

You will complete one of the parallel programming and analysis projects below. For _all_ project topics, you must address or satisfy all of the following.

- Combine two _different_ parallel programming models: distributed memory (i.e., MPI), shared memory (i.e., OpenMP), GPUs (i.e., CUDA or OpenACC).
- Explore different parallelization strategies (i.e., domain decomposition, task-based, etc.).
- Develop a _verification_ test to ensure the correctness of your solution. Ensure that the solution does not change with the number of parallel tasks.
- Address load balancing and strategies for maintaining balance as tasks are increased.
- Address memory usage and how it scales with tasks for your problem.
- Perform extensive scaling studies (i.e., weak, strong, thread-to-thread speedup). Your scaling studies should extend to as large a number of tasks as you are able to with your problem.
- All I/O should be handled with HDF5.

Note that for many of these project topics, parallel code can easily be obtained online. _You must develop your own original code to address your problem_. Researching your problem on the web is expected and encouraged, but I recommend you avoid looking directly at someone's code for inspiration.

For selecting the project, you must _bid_ for what you want to do. See the link posted to the course Slack channel. The possible project topics are listed bellow. 

### 1. Heat Equation

### 2. Jacobi Iteration

### 3. Ray Tracing

### 4. Poisson Equation

### 5. Conjugate Gradient

### 6. Agent Based Model

### 7. Advection Equation

### 8. Clustering Algorithm

### 9. Gaussian Elimination

### 10. Neural Network

### 11. Molecular Dynamics

### 12. Quicksort

### 13. N-body Simulation

### 14. Monte Carlo Transport

### 15. _Custom Project_

You may develop your own project topic, if you like. You must submit a 1-2 page proposal explaining the subject, the rationale for doing it as your class project, and specific strategies for how you will address all of the requirements for the projects listed above. 

## Project Reports

## Poster Presentation

You must submit your poster for printing to DECS using the online form [here](https://www.egr.msu.edu/decs/webform/poster-print-request). If you do _not_ have sufficient print page credit with DECS, speak with Prof. Couch. Submission to DECS is due *by Monday, December 3* in order to ensure your poster is ready for the mini-symposium *on December 6*. See the Slack channel for the rubric detailing how your poster will be evaluated.
